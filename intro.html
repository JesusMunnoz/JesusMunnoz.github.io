                <p>I am a junior web developer with a solid background in designing and developing user interfaces. 
                    I recently completed a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at Codenotch, where I became familiar with the latest technologies. 
                    <br><br>
                    My passion for interface design dates back to my degree studies in Video Game Design and Development at ESNE, where I specialized in UX/UI. During those years, I learned to understand and prioritize user needs to create engaging and user-friendly interactive experiences. 
                    Since then, I have continued refining my skills, working on projects that integrate both front-end and back-end, using frameworks such as Angular.</p>
